    <p class="govuk-body">
        The Department for Education is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Compliance status</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        This website is partially compliant with the WCAG version 2.1 AA standard, due to the following non-compliance(s) and exemptions. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        The content is non-accessible for the following reason(s): 
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
       <strong>Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</strong> 
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>main headings on some pages are contained within groups of elements and so may not be read out correctly by some screen reader software. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria 2.4.6 (Headings and Labels)</li>
        <li>some labelling on primary action buttons are not consistent. The labels were selected to give users a better description of the purpose of the action based on user research. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria 3.2.4 (Consistent Identification) </li>
